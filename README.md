Ar game based on the boardgame Squashed where each player has an 'army' of pieces to move around on a cube shaped board (where you can move on all sides) with the roll of a die. The top, middle space on the board is the king square that allows the player to rotate and smash one side of the cube, elimanating all of the army pieces on one side. The last player to have pieces left on the board wins.
